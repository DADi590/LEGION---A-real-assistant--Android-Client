		"RSSI = -10*n*log10(d)-A (4)
		In Equation 4, RSSI is the radio signal strength indicator in dBm, n is the signal propagation constant or

		communicating nodes [in meters], and A is a reference received signal strength in dBm (the RSSI value measured
		when the separation distance between the receiver and the transmitter is one meter)."

		(The formula seems to be from Texas Instruments on the CC2420 chip.)

		So getting d from there, we have this below. Should be RSSI+A, but that term is supposed to be 0 if both values
		are equal, with with a +, that won't happen, so I saw people having +A on the main formula, and then it results
		in:

		                         Empirical coefficient values for indoor propagation

		Empirical measurements of coefficients gamma and sigma in dB have shown the following values for a number of
		indoor wave propagation cases.

		Building Type                  Frequency of Transmission    gamma   sigma [dB]
		Vacuum, infinite space                                       2.0    0

		Commercial                            60 GHz                 1.7    7.9
		----------------
		[Note: our n here is gamma on Wikipedia.]

		So using the Office with soft-partition at 1.9 GHz with 2.6, knowing on 900 MHz it was 2.4, and also that
		Bluetooth operates at 2.4-2.5 GHz, 2.7-2.8 seems a good choice of value at home (so 2.75 - average).
		But that's only with objects in the way. If there's a straight path, 2.1 doesn't seem a bad value (there's the
		phone or computer case). So if the distance is very small, 2.1 will be used (can't be much in the way if the
		distance is like 1 meter with 2.75 as value).
		Another possibility is the object being further away. In case, then other objects might be in its path. Then we
		rise the value, depending on the distance. For example, 5 meters or more could have stuff in the way already.
		10-20 meters and even more stuff (not counting open field here... - can't guess this kind of thing without GPS).
		Else, 2.75 will be used.


		From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_loss:
		"In the study of wireless communications, path loss can be represented by the path loss exponent, whose value
		is normally in the range of 2 to 4 (where 2 is for propagation in free space, 4 is for relatively lossy
		environments and for the case of full specular reflection from the earth surfaceâ€”the so-called flat earth
		model). In some environments, such as buildings, stadiums and other indoor environments, the path loss exponent
		can reach values in the range of 4 to 6. On the other hand, a tunnel may act as a waveguide, resulting in a path
		loss exponent less than 2."

		So, 5 meters or more, could be 2.75 + (4+6)/2 = 3.875 = 3.88. For more than 20 meters, why not 6.0. On more than
		50 meters, I'll use 8.0. A person said n could reach from 2 to 8 in some cases. So I'll use that 8 value here.
		*/

		// This will be used if 2.0 < resulting distance < 7.5.
		final double ret_value = StrictMath.pow(10.0, (double) -(rssi - tx_power) / (10.0 * 2.75));

		if (ret_value <= 2.0) {
			// 2 meters here because it's near enough to 1 meter - can't be 1 meter because the idea of the if statements
			// is to correct incorrect calculation, so it's to assume if it gives about 2 meters, it might mean it's less
			// than that actually (like with my phone and tablet, a meter away from each other and this returning more
			// than 1 meter.
			return StrictMath.pow(10.0, (double) - (rssi - tx_power) / (10.0 * 2.1));
		} else if (ret_value >= 50.0) {
			return StrictMath.pow(10.0, (double) - (rssi - tx_power) / (10.0 * 8.0));
		} else if (ret_value >= 20.0) {
			return StrictMath.pow(10.0, (double) - (rssi - tx_power) / (10.0 * 6.0));
		} else if (ret_value >= 7.5) { // 7.5 meters because it's near enough to 5 meters and still away from 20 meters
			return StrictMath.pow(10.0, (double) - (rssi - tx_power) / (10.0 * 3.88));
		} else {
			return ret_value;
