android.permission.CAPTURE_VOICE_COMMUNICATION_OUTPUT
- To be able to record from any audio source desired

android.permission.READ_PRECISE_PHONE_STATE

Screen

------------Custom permissions------------

com.dadi590.assist_c_a.permission.INTERNAL_RECEIVERS
- This permission is for the entire app to communicate inside itself (internally). sendBroadcast() sends to all apps, so
  they must hold this permission to receive the broadcast (which they can only hold if they're signed with my signature)

com.dadi590.assist_c_a.permission.INCOMING_EXT_COMMS
- This permission exists for no other app to be able to communicate with this one, in the components that declare this
  permission (or that inherit it), except if it's some other app developed by me (same signature)


------------SuperSU permission------------

android.permission.ACCESS_SUPERUSER
- From https://su.chainfire.eu/#updates-permission:
  "X.4. ACCESS_SUPERUSER permission DEPRECATED
  Due to changes in Android 5.0 Lollipop, this permission has been deprecated and is completely ignored from SuperSU
  v2.30 onwards
  From SuperSU version 1.20 and onwards, the android.permission.ACCESS_SUPERUSER permission is declared by SuperSU."

  So it's a SuperSU deprecated permission, but leave it here anyways. Could be useful in some case.
